## Calling Android Java Class from C++ in a Qt6 Project

To call an Android Java class from C++ in a Qt6 project, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Qt Project with Android Support

Before integrating Java and C++ functionality, ensure your project is set up to run on Android. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. **Add a new component in your `.qml` file** and run the project on a mobile device to ensure the environment is correctly configured.
2. In your `.pro` file, include the following to link QtCore for Qt6:
   ```pro
   QT += core
   ```

### 2. Create the Java Class

Next, create your Java class that will be called from C++. Follow the steps below:

1. The path to your Java class should be structured as `android/src/<packageName>/<JavaClassName>`.
   
   Example: If your package name is `com.pushnotification`, and the class name is `MainActivity`, the path would be:
   ```
   android/src/com/pushnotification/MainActivity.java
   ```

2. Organize the folders accordingly and place your Java class (`MainActivity.java`) in the correct directory.

### 3. Update `build.gradle`

To avoid build issues like groovy errors, make sure to update the Gradle configuration. Modify `build.gradle` as follows:

1. Update the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` version to:
   ```groovy
   classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.2'
   ```

2. In your `gradle.properties`, set the following Android build versions:
   ```properties
   androidBuildToolsVersion=34.0.0
   androidCompileSdkVersion=34
   ```

3. If you're facing issues with the SDK version, consider downgrading the `androidCompileSdkVersion` to 31. Then, clean and rebuild the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

4. Enable MultiDex support by adding the following lines in the `build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   implementation 'androidx.multidex:multidex:2.0.1'

   android {
       defaultConfig {
           applicationId "com.pushnotification"
           multiDexEnabled true
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. Modify `gradle.properties`

In the `gradle.properties` file, ensure that the project uses AndroidX and Jetifier by adding these lines:
```properties
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

### 5. Call the Java Class from C++ Code

To call the Java class from your C++ code, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary Android-specific headers in your C++ class:
   ```cpp
   #ifdef Q_OS_ANDROID
   #include <qjniobject.h>
   #include <QtCore/qcoreapplication.h>
   #include <QJniEnvironment>
   #include <QJniObject>
   #endif
   ```

2. Use the following code to call the Java method from C++:
   ```cpp
   #ifdef Q_OS_ANDROID
       // Create a QJniObject from a QString
       QJniObject string1 = QJniObject::fromString("String1");

       // Call the static method in the Java class
       QJniObject::callStaticMethod<void>(
           "com/pushnotification/MainActivity", // Java class path
           "notify",                             // Java method name
           "(Landroid/content/Context;Ljava/lang/String;)V", // Method signature
           QNativeInterface::QAndroidApplication::context(), // Android context
           string1.object<jstring>()); // String parameter
   #endif
   ```

In this example, the method `notify` from `MainActivity.java` is being called. The `notify` method requires an Android context and a string as parameters.

By following these steps, you can successfully call Java methods from your C++ code in a Qt6 Android project. Be sure to clean and rebuild your project whenever making significant changes to the Gradle configuration or Java classes.
